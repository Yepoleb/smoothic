Minetest port of the Smoothic texture pack for Minecraft.
Made by Leozy and ported by Yepoleb. 

[Original Post](http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/smoothic/)

##Usage

The actual texture pack is the `minetest` folder, to install it rename it to `Smoothic` 
and follow the instructions on http://wiki.minetest.net/Installing_Texture_Packs.

##Modifications

The `original` folder is `/assets/minecraft/textures/` from the original resource pack, 
`custom` are modified textures and `minetest` will contain the final pack. 
`textures mapping.txt` is the most important file, it contains all Minetest texture filenames 
and their location in the `original` folder or `*custom*`/`*magick*` 
(these mean that there is a file with the same name in `custom` or it gets generated by imagemagick). 
`toscript.py` parses it, writes a cp instruction into `map.sh` for every line 
and appends the code in `magick.sh`. If you modified something, edit `textures mapping.txt` 
and run `toscript.py`. It should create `map.sh`, which you can use to generate the texture pack.
